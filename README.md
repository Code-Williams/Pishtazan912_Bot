# Main bots project for Pishtazan912
That's Pishtazan912's bots for whatsapp, it's simply send messages to whatsapp but bulk message.

## Why ?
### Why we built this project ?
First, that's so hard to send message to like +10000 numbers manually and we need a lot of time for done with this manually.\
But we can do it *Full Automatically*, That's so fast if we do it automatically.

### Why we use python in this project ?
Python is so good on AI and Web Scrapping, and it's also good on simulating web pages, that's easy to edit and easy to work on it.\
Everything we want to use is available in Python.

### Why we don't use API for sending message ?
In FaceBook's APIs we have rate limit but with this method we haven't.\
Also we want to built it fast so we do it (If we want to make it using FaceBook's APIs we want a token and we dont have enough time for working on that also it's fully customizable).

## Is that open source ?
No it's not, because it's not public on Iran and we built it just for Pishtazan, but maybe we do it like couple monthes.

## How to install ?
### Installing python
We need Python installed cause we built it just with Python. You can go to https://python.org/download for download python for linux, windows and mac.\
*Notice : When you want to install Python, make sure to enable `Add Python to path`*

### Installing packages
If you are on windows, you can simply open `install.bat` file and it's automatically installing anything we want on your computer (If you get an error for packages, check error and install anything error says).\
If you are on linux or mac you can copy this file and paste it on your terminal (You can do it by commands)(If you get error for `pip install` command, use `pip3 install` or `python -m pip install`).

## How to run code ?
For run code you can use `python *.py` or `python3 *.py` command. Make sure to run correct file (simply it's main.py).
